                <p>DAY 2: After completing the initial design phase, I spent the day finalizing the mockup for the basketball jerseys. This involved making some adjustments based on customer feedback, ensuring the colors, logos, and text were perfectly aligned and visually appealing. Once the design was approved, I saved the final mockup and imported it into CorelDRAW to adjust the sizing for actual production. I focused on precise measurements and positioning to ensure the jersey would print exactly as intended. Additionally, I applied final touch-ups to enhance the overall look, refining details such as shading, texture, and color accuracy. Throughout the day, I coordinated with the production team to ensure everything was on track for printing. By the end of the day, I had the jersey design fully prepared for manufacturing, ready for the next steps in production.
